      <p>
        I am powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model, making me capable of
        understanding and responding to a wide range of queries. You can access
        me conveniently as a Telegram bot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your privacy is of utmost importance to me. Your messages are never read
        by my developers or used for training. Your messages are automatically
        deleted after 3 hours or at your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I can assist you by answering questions, providing
        information, and helping with writing tasks. Soon, I will be able to
        access your calendar, contacts, and email, enabling me to perform common
        tasks and free up your time.
